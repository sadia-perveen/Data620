    "### Inference\n",
    "Based on the analysis, we can infer that the MovieLens dataset exhibits a high level of interconnectedness among users and movies, even when considering only higher ratings (4 or above). The presence of a single large group comprising 942 users and 1447 movies after thresholding suggests that a substantial portion of users are connected through their common appreciation for a large set of movies. This interconnected nature indicates that users' movie preferences are not isolated but rather form a broad network of shared tastes, which could be leveraged for collaborative filtering and recommendation purposes. The large size of this group highlights the potential for finding common patterns or clusters within the data, which could provide insights into user preferences and movie popularity."
